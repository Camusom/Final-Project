# Final-Project
I had a lot of fun coding this project. 

DIFFICULTIES:
  The first difficulty I had was making a working system for betting. I tried using many different functions for each type of bet, but I soon realized that it was not efficient or practical to code it that way. I then decided to just code all of the betting in one function, and I found that it was much easier like this. After this, I coded the different starting choices at the beginning to make for a smooth experience.
   The second difficulty that I had was with the prompts/inputs. The program would not reprompt the user after betting, however, this was a simple fix.
   The third difficulty was making the roulette wheel. Unfortunately, I could not find any references online, and I did not have enough time to code the roulette wheel in pygame. The "roulette wheel" that I did code with turtle is more annoying than practical, although I suppose it adds a little bit to the program by at least attempting to visualize a wheel.

THE GOOD THINGS:
  I can definitely say I learned a lot through this project. This project felt like one of my own labs; I knew what I wanted to code, and it took a lot of trial and error. However, once I figured out everything, it felt great to actually have a program that I could call my own. For the first time in this class, it felt like I made genuine progress in my coding/debugging abilities, and it was a great feeling. It made me realize that I know more than I thought, and that I'm a somewhat capable coder.
  
CONCLUSION:
To conclude, I do not think I fell short too far of my final vision. My final vision was to code a simple casino roulette game with a working roulette wheel, and I finished with a simple casino roulette game and a drawing of a wheel. All in all, I am proud of what I accomplished and hope to continue using Python.
